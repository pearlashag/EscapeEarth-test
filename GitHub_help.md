# FOR FILES ON YOUR COMPUTER


## to add a file to your FORKED EscapeEarth repo

1. open terminal & `cd` to the folder where your notebook is
2. type `git status` this will list all the files that git is tracking for you and their status
3. type `git add path/filename.ipynb` (replace filename with the name of your notebook, add path as well if necessary)
4. type `git status` now you should see the file you added in green, it is now staged to commit
5. type `git commit -m 'make a comment here in quotes describing file version/changes you made'` 
6. type `git status` look for the comment that says your branch is ahead of the origin/master, this confirms the file was committed
7. type `git push origin master` this pushes the file commit to the git hub website VERY IMPORTANT!


## to download (pull) files that have changed in our MAIN EscapeEarth repo

1. open terminal & `cd` into the folder EscapeEarth 
2. type `git status` and check for the message `Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.`
3. if you are not up to date type `git pull upsteam main`


## to pull files from your FORKED EscapeEarth repo (usually done if we pushed file from google colab first)
1. open terminal & `cd` into the folder EscapeEarth
2. type `git pull`





# HANDLING MERGE CONFLICTS

## if you forget to pull before you push something this can happen

1. git on the command line will tell you about a merge conflict -- EXAMINE THIS CAREFULLY: if conflict is due to missing files, proceed below; if conflict is due to different versions of the same file - tell me, we'll need an individual solution
2. emacs will open within the terminal window asking for a reason the merge is needed
3. type a "message" that explains what caused the merge conflict
4. press the `control` and `x` keys simultaneously (this saves your message)
5. press the `control` and `c` keys simultaneously (this exits emacs & returns the window)
6. type `git pull` to pull the missing files 
7. type `git status` to verify you are not up-to-date. i.e. you should see something like this: `Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits.`
8. type `git push` to finish your original commit
